# ChatGPT-Based Storytelling Project

This directory contains my submission for the **ChatGPT-Based Storytelling** course‑end project.  
It showcases an interactive fantasy adventure built using ChatGPT.

## Files

- `interactive_story.md`: the source code for the interactive, branching narrative.  
- `interactive_story.docx`: a written report describing the theme, characters, branching logic and process for creating the story.  
- `screenshot.png`: an illustrative image representing the Whispering Woods setting used in the story.  
- `README.md`: this file, providing context for the submission.

## Project overview

The story is set in the mystical land of **Eldoria**.  Players follow a team of heroes—Aria, Finn and Nyx—into the Whispering Woods to uncover the source of a creeping darkness.  Along the way, readers make decisions that lead to different challenges and outcomes, demonstrating how ChatGPT can be used to build **choose‑your‑own‑adventure** narratives without coding.

The project follows the steps outlined in the course assignment: defining a theme and characters, crafting an engaging narrative, incorporating user choices to create branching paths, and concluding with multiple possible endings.
