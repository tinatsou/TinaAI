# AI Agent Platform – Edge & Open Source Focus

This project uses **LlamaIndex** to enable retrieval‑augmented workflows over domain data, and integrates with edge agents (robot arm, voice interface) and open‑source ecosystems.

## Features

- Ingest documentation, logs, and APIs into an index
- Build query engines for developer ecosystem questions
- Edge module for robotics (voice and control)
- Open‑source integration workflows (e.g., LF Edge, OPEA)

## Repository Structure

The repository contains placeholders for various components, including:

- `data/` – domain documents and raw data
- `backend/` – indexing and API server code
- `edge_agent/` – interfaces for devices and robotics
- `docs/` – architectural and deployment documentation

These files are currently placeholders and should be filled in with actual implementation as needed.
